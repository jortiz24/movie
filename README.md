Made a fun little thing to use with my friends

We have movie nights and it tracks our movies

So far I have implemented:

-Database thats not actually a database I store it locally

-Bot stores movies and who suggested them in a dict

-Uses date library and time to manage and cycle through people and track next meeting

-Can show all the movies currently stored by each person

-Delete from the movie dictionary if nicknames/usernames change

-Auto disconnect/close on idle, Has a close app commmand as well

-I'm still working ill add more eventually
