Made a fun little thing to use with my friends

We have movie nights and it tracks our movies

Update: Main functionality has been changed but old code is still available just not really supported for my app


Changes

-Replaced text log functionality with Google Firebase for data

-Created a pool to add movies and pick from instead of ordered users for more flexibility

-Keeps track of previously watched movies

-Retains old functions just not primary use or interchangable with Firebase data
