Made a fun little thing to use with my friends

We have movie nights and it tracks our movies

So far I have implemented:

-Database thats not actually a database I store it locally in text

-Bot stores movies, who suggested them in a dict and what order the movies/users are in

-Uses date library and time to manage and cycle through people and track next meeting

-Can show all the movies currently stored by each person

-Order can be randomized or offset by a week both forwards and backwards(will add individual switches)

-Delete from the movie dictionary if nicknames/usernames change

-Auto disconnect/close on idle, Has a close app commmand as well

-Auto ping with timer set to a designated movie night and time(Set for thursday, will make it adjustable)

-Commands alongside on message commands(Commands work but in the menu for slash commands clicking them doesn't)

-Added API for movie searches, if google search finds a match it adds movie and provides a link to the movie
